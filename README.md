A (partial) porting of scala [monocle](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle) library to TypeScript

# Motivation

(Adapted from [monocle site](http://julien-truffaut.github.io/Monocle/))

Modifying immutable nested object in JavaScript is verbose which makes code difficult to understand and reason about.

Let's have a look at some examples:

```ts
interface Street { num: number, name: string }
interface Address { city: string, street: Street }
interface Company { name: string, address: Address }
interface Employee { name: string, company: Company }
```

Letâ€™s say we have an employee and we need to upper case the first character of his company street name. Here is how we could write it in vanilla JavaScript

```ts
const employee: Employee = {
  name: "john",
  company: {
    name: "awesome inc",
    address: {
      city: "london",
      street: {
        num: 23,
        name: "high street"
      }
    }
  }
}

const capitalize = (s: string): string => s.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + s.substring(1)

const employee2 = {
  ...employee,
  company: {
    ...employee.company,
    address: {
      ...employee.company.address,
      street: {
        ...employee.company.address.street,
        name: capitalize(employee.company.address.street.name)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As we can see copy is not convenient to update nested objects because we need to repeat ourselves. Let's see what could we do with `monocle-ts`

```ts
import { Lens, Optional } from 'monocle-ts'

const company = Lens.fromProp<Employee, 'company'>('company')
const address = Lens.fromProp<Company, 'address'>('address')
const street = Lens.fromProp<Address, 'street'>('street')
const name = Lens.fromProp<Street, 'name'>('name')

company.compose(address).compose(street).compose(name)
```

`compose` takes two `Lenses`, one from `A` to `B` and another one from `B` to `C` and creates a third `Lens` from `A` to `C`.
Therefore, after composing `company`, `address`, `street` and `name`, we obtain a `Lens` from `Employee` to `string` (the street name).
Now we can use this `Lens` issued from the composition to modify the street name using the function `capitalize`

```ts
company
  .compose(address)
  .compose(street)
  .compose(name)
  .modify(capitalize)(employee)
```

Here `modify` lift a function `string => string` to a function `Employee => Employee`. It works but it would be clearer if we could zoom
into the first character of a `string` with a `Lens`. However, we cannot write such a `Lens` because `Lenses` require the field they are directed
at to be *mandatory*. In our case the first character of a `string` is optional as a `string` can be empty. So we need another abstraction that
would be a sort of partial Lens, in `monocle-ts` it is called an `Optional`.

```ts
import { some, none } from 'fp-ts/lib/Option'

const firstLetter = new Optional<string, string>(
  s => s.length > 0 ? some(s[0]) : none,
  a => s => a + s.substring(1)
)

company
  .compose(address)
  .compose(street)
  .compose(name)
  .asOptional()
  .compose(firstLetter)
  .modify(s => s.toUpperCase())(employee)
```

Similarly to `compose` for lenses, `compose` for optionals takes two `Optionals`, one from `A` to `B` and another from `B` to `C` and creates a third `Optional` from `A` to `C`.
All `Lenses` can be seen as `Optionals` where the optional element to zoom into is always present, hence composing an `Optional` and a `Lens` always produces an `Optional`.
